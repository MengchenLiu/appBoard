This is a web application in Ruby on Rails to achieve the functionality similar to a dash board.

 After log into the application for the first time you can see a page containing graphic links (shapes) to other programs. The programs of first visit to the site are the ones shown to new users by default. (Google and GLBRC)

Users can customize the programs that are shown to them by selecting not to see one or more programs that are currently showing and by adding other programs from a list of available applications. The links are also able to be ordered by dragging and dropping.
